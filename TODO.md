###PRIORITY (In Order)

- [x] Commenting and documentation of the libraries

- [x] Collision with bullets (Killing enemies)

- [x] Screen Shake (Give a good punch when shooting)

- Shooting with mouse click* (Under Debate)

- Camera movement with the mouse* (Under Debate)

- Shooting based on cursor position* (Under Debate)

- Level moving with the player in center* (Player's position slightly changed based on camera/cursor position)

- Setting level boundaries (Can't move after reaching the edge of a box like Agar.io)

- Random drop system

####COSMETIC (Later Development)

+ Assets for the in game characters

+ Music

+ Particle Effects

+ Sound Effects* (Would help to have a good shooting sound early)

####FEEL (Stuff to give impact to, in order)

+ Shooting

+ Eliminating enemies

Article on the feel for Nuclear Throne (main inspiration) http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/10/21/interview-jan-willem-nijman-on-nuclear-thrones-feel/

####SIZE TARGET

+ Randomly gen enemies in a large field (Think Agar.io as the level design)

+ Make shooting feel good

+ Have rogue like power ups/weapons

+ Perma-death

+ Some good music and sounds


####Possible features later (Might be too time consuming or less important):

+ Main Menu

+ Bosses

+ Cookie Clicker/Adventure Capitalist/MGSV type meta game after you lose

+ Levels (get rid of random enemy gen, instead of large field pick a pre-made level from a selection)

+ Larger enemy variety (instead of 1, have 7-15)

+ Save States

+ Game ending

####Side features (Not important, but might make things more fun if we have time):

+ MP (Local and/or Online)
